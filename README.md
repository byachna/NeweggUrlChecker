# NeweggUrlChecker
 Newegg Search Result URL Checker

## Usage
- Copy and paste a URL from one of the newegg search result pages and paste it into the URL field at the top of the application.
- Set your refresh interval and click "Run"
- When a search result is listed as "in Stock" the row will display with a "Green" background in the grid.
- You can click the Newegg item number all the way in the right column to add the item to cart directly.


## NOTE: This is by no means a "finished" application. It's just a simple application I created so that I don't have to constantly deal with juggling web browser windows.

## Feel free to modify the code and create pull requests here. I'd like to see what you guys can do!

### Also - If you want to chat, you can hit me up on Discord (Europort#7040) or steam (Yatch).
